### This solution will only work properly if you have Noita installed through Steam and are using Windows.

Here is what the .bat file does:

- Set some variables
- Check if Steam is installed
- Warn the user to make a backup
- If we never made a backup, make a backup
- Since we *SHOULD* be backed up now, delete the save directory
- Restore crown and amulet cosmetics
- Launch Noita through Steam

That's it. If you have ways of making this more robust, recommend changes. Have fun!
